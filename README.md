# What is this?
This is my ongoing attempt to codifying my understanding of modern compilers as a simple Python application. It aims to replicate the key concepts, techniques and infrastructure in Python - because of this, actual implementation details wont always match, but the point it to learn fundamentals, not create an indentical (and less optimal) copy!

# Why Python?
To learn! The focus is to learn key concepts, not obsess over language details.
